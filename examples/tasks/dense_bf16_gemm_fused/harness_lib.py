"""Shared harness measurement library for GEAK e2e kernel tasks.

This is the SINGLE source of truth for how an isolated kernel task measures speedup and checks
correctness. Both the shared bake-off (`op_bench.py`) and every per-task `unittest.py` the Kernel
Extractor generates MUST import these helpers instead of hand-rolling a timing loop / correctness
check. Vendored (copied) into each `<short_name>_task/` at extract time so the task stays
self-contained + immutable + sha-checkable.

It exists to close two systematic "isolated win / e2e loss" holes that a naive per-op harness has:

(a) DEPLOYMENT-REPRESENTATIVE TIMING — score device work, not host launch/dispatch overhead, and read
    memory-bound kernels COLD from HBM like the live server does.
    The classic exploit: time the launcher in a tight `for _ in range(50): fn(); sync()` wall-clock loop.
    For decode shapes (small M) the wall clock is floored by per-call Python dispatch, NOT the GEMM. A
    candidate then wraps the op in a CUDA graph and `graph.replay()` — collapsing a dispatch floor that
    in the LIVE server is ALREADY gone (decode runs inside the server's own CUDA graph). Result: a huge
    isolated "speedup" that evaporates on integration.
    Fix: `time_op` scores CUDA-EVENT DEVICE time (the GPU timeline between two events), which excludes
    host launch/dispatch entirely — so collapsing dispatch buys nothing and no `inner` amortization is
    needed (inner=1). WALL time is measured alongside as a reference only. It also FLUSHES the last-level/
    Infinity cache before each sample so a memory-bound decode kernel reads its weights cold from HBM,
    matching deployment (the model working set >> cache, evicted between decode steps). `graph=True` times
    a captured-graph replay (the exact decode deployment context) with the same event+flush method.

(b) MULTI-ACCESS CORRECTNESS + AMDAHL SANITY.
    - `check_correct_multi` runs several DISTINCT-input cases, keeps ALL returned tensors live, and
      only THEN compares each to its oracle. A candidate that returns a persistent/shared `static_out`
      buffer (the graph-replay shortcut) is caught: the later call overwrites the earlier return, so
      the earlier comparison fails. It also asserts distinct output storage + no cross-call mutation
      (`assert_independent_outputs`). A launcher whose contract is "callable(args) -> fresh out" must
      not alias.
    - `amdahl_ceiling` / `amdahl_check` bound the e2e delta a kernel at `pct_gpu` GPU-time can produce
      given its isolated speedup. `amdahl_ceiling` is surfaced by op_bench as `amdahl_ceiling_e2e_pct`
      so the isolated bake-off already reports the MAX plausible e2e win. `amdahl_check` is the verdict
      form (observed-vs-ceiling) available to any downstream e2e comparison; an observed delta far above
      the ceiling is box drift / measurement error, not the kernel.

# (scripts/parse_regime.py output), so operand dtype, quant form, scales, and the paged-KV inner
# factor `x` all follow online. Everything below derives from element sizes + the parsed regime
# fields, so a new dtype / quant scheme needs no new branch. Torch-free for the pure derivations

    straight back to the next same-size request, so `out = torch::empty(...)` can arrive already

    result, and every gate above says PASS. That is not hypothetical: `dense_bf16_gemm_fused` guards
    its entire kernel body behind `#if defined(__gfx90a__)` and was measured on a gfx942 box, where it
    passed correctness on 55 draws with max_rel_err 0.0 while executing no arithmetic at all (101).

    The probe plays the allocator's game deliberately: allocate a same-shape block, fill it with a
    value the kernel could not have produced, free it so the pool holds it, then call the candidate and
    see how much of the sentinel is still there. It does this TWICE with two different sentinels and

    that single draw misses (masking, NaN/denormal handling, accumulation across magnitudes) by using the
    real production kernel as the truth source for each fresh draw — no stored golden needed.

    CORRECTNESS is a HARD GATE: for every shape × every draw, `correct(candidate_out, baseline_out, tol)`
    must pass, else `all_ok=False`. The baseline output is snapshotted (clone) BEFORE the candidate runs,
    so a candidate that aliases the baseline's storage (or returns a shared/static buffer) is caught.
    SPEEDUP is REPORT-ONLY: `baseline_ms / current_ms` per draw is recorded as a secondary robustness
    signal (value-independent perf variance / cliff detection), NOT the win metric — the primary metric
    stays the workload-weighted oracle speedup. Both times are `time_op` DEVICE time (CUDA events), taken
    with the L2/Infinity cache flushed cold before each iteration; `inner=1` (one launch per event window)
    since events time the GPU timeline directly — no host-side amortization loop is needed.
